# set is a collection of unique elements.no duplicate elements are allowed.

#disctionary and set both are defined using curly braces {}. so we can use  set() function to create a empty set.


empty_set = set() # empty set
empty_dictionary = {} # empty dictionary




print(type(empty_set))  # <class 'set'>
