# pass is a null statement in Python. It is used when a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed.
# It is often used as a placeholder for future code or in situations where the code is not yet implemented.


for i in range(1,10):
    pass # without pass, the program will throw an error because the loop is empty.


i=0
while(i<10):
    print(i)
    i+=1
