# tuples are same as lists but immutable.
# they are defined using parentheses () while list are defined using []

a=(1) # in the tuples only one element  is consider as a integer and not as a tuple
a=(1,) # to define a tuple with one element we need to add a comma after the element

# this will give an error as tuples are immutable
